Folder "stream" contains modified protocol where weights in set/get/update are
streamed in chunks between workers and master. This is due to a limit on
protobuf size in earlier implementations. The limit in removed in version 3.6.

When building with earlier protobuf implementation one can use "stream" version,
or create a local copy of google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h and change default
value of CodedOutputStream::kDefaultTotalBytesLimit to INT_MAX (an easier option).
